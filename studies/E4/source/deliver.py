 'R1’s abstract currently emphasizes one archived71.7% improvement. Keep it only with its study attribution; revise the overall abstract/conclusion to reflect the mixed newer evidence and strong anchor-only controls. Distinguish the original positive-gain scalar system from the newer negative-gain logistic system. Replace the old statement that a regenerated-data/retrained resolution study is still needed, because E3 supplies that study. Preserve fixed matched-slope theorem scope and conditional error-envelope requirements; empirical resampling remains a sensitivity diagnostic.','',
 'The next manuscript revision should consolidate the main article to eight coherent sections, place full protocols and dataset tables in the supplement, integrate E1–E4, update code availability truthfully, and compile/inspect both complete Overleaf projects.
